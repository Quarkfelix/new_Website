                        I'm 19 years old and love Computers and everything that comes with them. After my Realschulabschluss in DATUM 
                        I decided to go to a Tecnical Gymnasium with IT as its schwerpunkt. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was when I was first introduced to the beautiful world of Programming. Alltough very confusing at first I started to love coding.
                        In my first Year I allmost exclusively workt with Java. I wrote multiple console- programms and games. After I got bored with the console Inteface I looked into GUI's. 
                        <br>
                        About this time we got our first Programming exam. We were suppost to write a classic Textadventure with a console Interface, witch would be graded after a half year.
                        Because I allready started to write my own little Libary for gui components I decided to ditch the console Interface and make a Gameboy/pokemon like Textadventure. 
                        Alltough I did not meet all my expectations It was a nice Project for witch I got a A. =)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over time I got more and more into Programming and explored into all different directions. In one of my latest Projetcs for example I went and made a Minecraft Hack client 
                        witch I of course never used on any third party server. ;)
